# Support Vector Machine in Python

Aim of this project is to implement Support Vector Machine for classification using scikit-learn and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel. The training data set contains continuous and categorical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease.
